Welcome to the IDF Frontend Code Challenge!
===========================================

Welcome to the IDF code challenge. This is fairly simple code challenge, which lets us get a sense of your coding style and choices. 

Don't be alarmed. We're not looking for "right and wrongs" and there are no "trick parts" in this challenge. We would merely like to get a deeper impression of how you write code. That will also allow us to have a more fruitful and constructive discussion at the technical interview. We're not fans of white-boarding at interviews so we'd much rather have some concrete code to talk about. We think that makes the interview much more enjoyable and productive.

That said, we hope you will put a lot of efforts into some of the details so that we get a chance to see you shine - despite the simplicity of the challenge. 


## Your challenge/task
Imagine you're our new front-end ðŸ¦„ and you just got a feature request! 

You've just stepped into the middle of a conversation on a Github issue and here is what was said:

Our Designer (feature requester) wrote the following:
> Hey Devs. A fantastic opportunity just came up through a few of our so-called Educational Partners (EPs), which are partner websites. It would be wonderful if you guys could implement an embeddable widget for IDF's articles that can be used on any of these 3rd party websites. I've already made a design for you as a [zeplin file](https://zpl.io/25GgeQJ) and you can log in with the credentials:
>  username: `idf_unicorn`
> password: `unicorn`
> (The Zeplin website may show a dialogue saying that "you're not invited to this project" but simply click "ok" and you can still see the design)

Then, few minutes later, our product owner added the following to the conversation:
> Hey guys! Could we please add a "Load more articles" button to this widget?
I think such a button would be very helpful. 

After 2 hours, a backend developer said:
> Roger that. I've implemented backend APIs for both calls:
> - https://www.interaction-design.org/widgets/articles?ep=usabilitygeek where `ep` is the slug for the given "ep" (Educational Partner) 
> - https://www.interaction-design.org/widgets/articles/load-more/the-power-of-white-space?ep=usabilitygeek where `the-power-of-white-space` is the slug of the latest already loaded article.

...and that was the latest message on that Github issue. 

So, your goal is now to implement the front-end part of this feature. At this moment, you don't have a design for the "Load more button"
so you'll just go ahead and implement it and then ask for a design after your implementation.

There are no set-in-stone technical requirements for this feature because neither the designer nor the backend developer will be able to provide you with such requirements.

You are of course more than welcome to ask questions about this challenge in case you're in doubt about something or need more background information!

## Recommendations
We know it's a pretty simple and straightforward challenge without any exotic or bleeding-edge technological requirements. We made it that way because we're respectful of your time. However, given the simplicity of the challenge, we hope you will take the opportunity to really polish some of the details so that your solution will shine ðŸ¦„


## How to submit your solution
Please submit your solution in a git repository. You can use services like GitHub or Bitbucket. Ideally, you could make an initial commit with the files of this code challenge and then build your solution upon that.

You can submit your solution in 2 ways:
 1. Build your solution in a public git repository and send us the link.
 2. Donâ€™t want to create a public repository for personal reasons? No problem! You can simply create a private one (hint: Bitbucket allows you to do it for free) and then provide read access for the following user: `idf-bot` (valid for [GitHub](https://github.com/idf-bot) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/idf-bot/)).
